# 2D Ambient Occlusion (Soft Shadowing)
This repository contains a class that is capable of taking a 2D image
and generate a shadow on the surface behind it, and shadows itself.
For the best results, use pixel art that is drawn from a side angle
or a top-down view. Other angles or non-pixel art can be used, but
some adjustment may have to be made to get it to work properly.
